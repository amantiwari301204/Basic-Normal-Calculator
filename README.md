# Basic Normal Calculator

A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations:  
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage.

Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with optional support for the **math.js** library.

## 🔧 Running the Project

Modern browsers block JavaScript when opening files directly using the `file://` protocol.  
Because of this, the calculator will **not** work if you double-click `index.html`.

You must run it through a local HTTP server.

### **Steps**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amantiwari301204/Basic-Normal-Calculator
